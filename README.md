# Predictive_Routing_for_EV_Charging_Stations

This repository contains a project that aims to provide a predictive routing solution for electric vehicle (EV) users, taking into account EV charging station locations, battery charge, and charging time. The project utilizes a road network graph, EV charging station data, and machine learning techniques to calculate the shortest path and recommend the nearest charging station if necessary.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of EV charging station information in Delhi, India procured from Delhi Government's official website. It includes attributes such as latitude, longitude, payment modes, vendor names, and station types. The dataset has been preprocessed to remove duplicates and encode categorical variables. The csv document consists of 25 columns across 2706 rows.
